      <description>We are moving the group from Meetup to Heylo. Heylo offers us the same facilities that we currently use on Meetup but is simpler to use and much better value. Please join us there: https://link.heylo.co/j7nz Our subscription to Meetup services expires on October 3, 2023. We have updated the Meetup group description to explain the change, and no further meeting changes or announcements will be made there. No change to the meeting times or location is planned at the moment so if you aren&amp;rsquo;t able to join Heylo immediately then you can still attend at the usual time.</description>
