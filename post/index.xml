      <description>You may have noticed that our meeting is no longer listed on Duolingo. The meeting is still on, and everyone is welcome to join!
However our Zoom meeting link is unacceptable to Duolingo for some reason and it cannot be listed as the official online meeting link. This means that Duolingo members do not receive XP when they join the meeting. Some people have complained to Duolingo about this and their Event Manager has started forwarding the complaints to the member of our group who posts the meetings there.</description>
